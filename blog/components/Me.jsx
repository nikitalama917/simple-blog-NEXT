          I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with major in Mathematics at May'21. 
          I enjoy innovation and love to experiment with different ideas. I was fascinated with computers from a young age, 
          so I decided to continue in that direction. Overall, it has been a great choice for me as my 
          biggest passion lies in learning about software and technology and being a software developer, I get to shape how the internet is 
          progressing and how websites are evolving, and thatâ€™s exciting to me.

           Besides working full time I love hiking or exploring some green place for fun. 
           Nature is like an escape to me, so mostly on weekends, I like to go for a mini-vacation anywhere near town.
           I also love exploring new games and go crazy for puzzles.
           Lately I've gotten really interested in personal finance, so I read a lot of books as well.
